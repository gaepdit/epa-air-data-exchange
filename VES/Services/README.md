# VES Services

This folder contains the SQL queries and XSLT stylesheets used by the services
in VESA.

- SQL queries are entered in the "SQL Statement" field on the VESA Service
  Details page. Note that the queries in this repository have been reformatted
  for legibility, and the filters have been disabled. All line breaks must be
  removed and filters re-enabled before the queries can be used in VESA.

- XSLT stylesheets must be uploaded using the VESA "Transfer Files" tool, then
  entered in the "Style Sheet" field on the Service Details page.
